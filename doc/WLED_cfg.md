# WLED Configuration File Specification
This section covers the WLED Configuration YAML files that can be used to generate presets JSON files for 
uploading to a WLED instance. If you are not familiar with YAML, have a look at [YAML Ain’t Markup Language (YAML™)](YAML.md).

## WLED Configuration YAML file

As mentioned elsewhere in this documentation, I use static WLED cfgs and do not use wled_yaml2json for managing my 
WLED cfg files. Because of that I have not completed this section, 
nor have I tested the functionality recently. Use it at your own risk. 

If there is sufficient interest I will consider putting some effort into this functionality and documentation.

If you do want to try using this package to manage your cfg files you might start by backing up an existing 
WLED configuration and using json2yaml.py to convert it to YAML as a starting point.
